# Twitter Follower Correlation Matrix

This notebook helps collecting follower information of some twitter accounts and calculates the correlation matrix of them.

You will need a twitter-api key set. You should fill in your credentials in the following code block:

```python
consumer_key = "CONSUMER_KEY_HERE"
consumer_secret = "CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE"
access_token_key = "ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY_HERE"
access_token_secret = "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_HERE"
```
